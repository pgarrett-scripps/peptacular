# Summary

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics depends on computational methods to identify and characterize AA sequences. These sequences, ranging from short peptides to complete proteins, exhibit substantial chemical complexity due to PTMs, variable charge states, neutral losses, and isotopic patterns [@smith-2013; @angel-2012]. **Peptacular** is a fully type-annotated Python library designed to handle this complexity. The library provides functionality for modifying, calculating mass, m/z, isotopic distributions, physicochemical properties, enzymatic digestion, and fragmentation of AA sequences. Built around the standardized ProForma 2.1 notation, it supports nearly all ProForma features.

# Statement of Need

Historically, the proteomics field has lacked standardization for representing AA sequences. Individual software tools have implemented proprietary notations, which has created barriers to data integration and reanalysis across platforms. ProForma notation [@leduc-2018] was developed to address this challenge by providing a unified representation system. However, adoption has remained limited, partly due to insufficient support in widely-used computational tools and libraries. Peptacular was designed specifically to accelerate ProForma adoption by offering a comprehensive and accessible API with clear documentation.

Additionally, with the continued advance of mass spectrometers, modern proteomics experiments routinely identify tens of thousands of AA Sequences. These results are typically exported as tabular files and are frequently processed using Python, particularly with data manipulation libraries such as **pandas** [@team-2025] and **polars** [@vink-2025]. To support this workflow, Peptacular's functional API supports operating directly on these tabular data structures and automatically parallelizes operations, making large-scale sequence analysis both fast and straightforward (See examples).

# State of the Field

Several Python packages provide AA sequence analysis capabilities, though each exhibits either limitations in ProForma support, API complexity, or python compatibility. **Pyteomics** [@goloborodko-2013] recently added partial ProForma support while maintaining its legacy notation system, requiring format conversions that are not universally supported. **BioPython** [@cock-2009] offers basic sequence property calculations without ProForma support; its API complexity reflects a broad scope encompassing DNA, RNA, and protein analysis. **RustyMS** [@Schulte_mzcore] delivers comprehensive ProForma parsing through Rust bindings with excellent performance, though it focuses primarily on parsing rather than sequence modification and requires PyO3 updates before supporting new Python versions. **PyOpenMS** [@rost-2013] provides extensive mass spectrometry tools without ProForma compatibility; its C++ backend with Python bindings similarly delays support for new Python releases.

Peptacular was designed to fill a specific gap: a pure Python library that implements nearly all ProForma 2.1 features while providing both an intuitive API, comprehensive documentation, and still remaining performant. Developing Peptacular from scratch rather than extending existing tools provided three advantages. First, ProForma notation serves as the foundation rather than a retrofitted addition, enabling complete feature coverage and a cleaner API. Second, the library targets AA sequence analysis specifically, avoiding complexity from broader scope. Third, the pure Python implementation ensures compatibility with modern Python versions, including free-threaded builds with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) disabled, which will become increasingly relevant as Python's parallelization capabilities improve.

# Software Design

Peptacular provides two primary APIs: a functional API and an object-oriented API. The object-oriented API employs a factory pattern to modify Proforma Annotation objects, enabling precise control over annotations. The functional API provides functions that operate directly on serialized sequences and annotations, with automatic parallelization for batch processing.

The built-in parallelization supports three execution backends: sequential, threaded, and process-based (default). Sequential execution provides single-threaded processing for small batches where parallelization overhead is detrimental. Thread-based parallelization currently offers limited benefits due to the GIL but will improve as free-threaded Python builds become standard. Process-based parallelization is the default and most widely supported method. Process and thread spawning mechanisms (fork, spawn, forkserver) are globally configurable, and worker processes are cached to eliminate startup overhead.

Three performance optimizations enable efficient large-scale processing. First, lazy evaluation keeps modifications in serialized form until calculations require parsed representations, minimizing memory overhead. Second, aggressive caching exploits the fact that proteomics datasets typically contain a small number of repeated modifications. Third, conditional initialization instantiates modification-specific data structures only when needed, reducing memory footprint and accelerating object creation.

Modification reference data, including masses, compositions, and identifiers from Unimod [@creasy-2004], PSI-MOD [@hupo-psi-no-date], RESID [@unknown-author-no-date], XLMOD [@hupo-psi-no-dateB], and GNOme [@glygen-glycan-data-no-date], are provided by the companion package **Tacular** [@garrett-2026-tacular]. This package embeds the data directly within itself as Python modules rather than storing them as external files. Only valid modifications are included in the embedded data; a modification is considered valid if it possesses at least one of the following properties: average mass, monoisotopic mass, or chemical formula. This design eliminates file I/O overhead during the parsing of supported ontologies. 

The package includes full type annotations with a py.typed marker, which enables static type checking and provides IDE autocomplete, inline documentation, and compile-time error detection. Test coverage exceeds 70%, with continuous integration implemented through GitHub Actions.

# Research impact statement

Since its initial release, Peptacular has demonstrated measurable adoption. The package has accumulated over **33k** downloads from PyPI, with sustained weekly download rates exceeding 200 installations. It has been recognized as one of 3 python packages to support Proforma notation by the PSI group. Additionally, Peptacular was used to generate figures within a textbook chapter [@garrett-2025]. 

# Example Usage

## Object-Based API

```python
import peptacular as pt

# Parse a sequence into a ProFormaAnnotation
peptide: pt.ProFormaAnnotation = pt.parse("PEM[Oxidation]TIDE")

# Calculate mass and m/z
mass: float = peptide.mass() # 849.342
mz: float = peptide.mz(charge=2) # 425.678

# Factory pattern
print(peptide.set_charge(2).set_peptide_name("Peptacular").serialize())
# (>Peptacular)PEM[Oxidation]TIDE/2
```

## Functional-Based API

```python
import peptacular as pt

peptides = ['[Acetyl]-PEPTIDES', '<C13>ARE', 'SICK/2']

# Calculate mass and m/z for all peptides
masses: list[float] = pt.mass(peptides) # [928.4026, 374.1914, 451.2454]
mzs: list[float] = pt.mz(peptides, charge=2) # [465.2086, 188.103, 225.6227]
```

## Pandas-Functional API

```python
import peptacular as pt
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "seq": ["PEM[Oxidation]TIDE", "ACDEFGHIK", "M[Phospho]NOPQR"],
    }
)

df["mass"] = df["seq"].apply(pt.mass)
```

# Mathematics

Peptacular implements algorithms for molecular mass calculations and isotopic pattern prediction. The following sections formalize the mathematical framework underlying these calculations.

## Base Mass

The base mass $M_{base}$ of a peptide sequence with modifications is calculated as the sum of all constituent components:

$M_{base} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} + M_{N} + M_{C} + M_{S} + M_{I} + M_{R} + M_{U} + \mathbb{1}_{\textrm{precursor}} \cdot M_{L}$

**where**:

- $n$ is the sequence length
- $m_{AA_i}$ is the monoisotopic (or average) mass of amino acid at position $i$
- $M_{N}$ is the total mass of N-terminal modifications
- $M_{C}$ is the total mass of C-terminal modifications
- $M_{S}$ is the total mass of static/fixed modifications
- $M_{I}$ is the total mass of position-specific modifications
- $M_{R}$ is the total mass of modifications within defined sequence intervals
- $M_{U}$ is the total mass of modifications with unknown positions
- $M_{L}$ is the total mass of labile modifications
- $\mathbb{1}_{\textrm{precursor}}$ is an indicator function: 1 for precursor ions, 0 for fragment ions

Labile modifications are only included in precursor ion mass calculations and excluded from all fragment ion types.

## Neutral Mass

The neutral mass $M_{\textrm{neutral}}$ of a fragment ion is calculated by combining the base mass with ion-type, isotope modifications, neutral deltas.

$M_{\textrm{neutral}} = M_{\textrm{base}} + M_{\textrm{ion}} + M_{\textrm{isotope}} + M_{\textrm{ndelta}}$

**where**:

- $M_{\textrm{base}}$ is the peptide base mass from the previous section
- $M_{\textrm{ion}}$ is the ion-type-specific mass offset
- $M_{\textrm{isotope}}$ is the mass shift from a specific isotopic species
- $M_{\textrm{ndelta}}$ is the mass change from neutral losses/gains

## Mass-to-charge Ratio

The mass-to-charge ratio is calculated by incorporating charge carriers and electron mass corrections to the neutral mass:

$\frac{m}{z} = \frac{M_{\textrm{neutral}} + M_{\textrm{adduct}} - z \cdot m_e}{z}$

where:

- $M_{\textrm{neutral}}$ is the neutral fragment mass
- $M_{\textrm{adduct}}$ is the total mass of charge carriers
- $z$ is the total charge state
- $m_e = 0.0005485799$ Da (electron mass)

## Isotopic Distribution

The isotopic distribution of a peptide is calculated by convolving the isotopic patterns of all constituent elements. For a peptide with elemental composition $\{E_1: n_1, E_2: n_2, ..., E_k: n_k\}$, the isotopic distribution is:

$P(\textrm{total}) = P(E_1)^{n_1} \otimes P(E_2)^{n_2} \otimes ... \otimes P(E_k)^{n_k}$

where $P(E_i)$ is the natural isotopic distribution of element $E_i$, $n_i$ is the count of that element, and $\otimes$ represents the convolution operation.

The computational complexity of isotopic distribution calculations scales with the number of isotopic peaks retained during the convolution process. To balance accuracy with computational efficiency, Peptacular implements several thresholding parameters that limit the number of peaks propagated through successive convolution operations. These thresholds allow users to control the trade-off between calculation precision and processing time based on their specific application requirements.

### Averagine Model

When the exact elemental composition is unknown, the averagine model estimates composition from molecular mass using empirically-derived ratios. The averagine values were calculated by determining the cumulative number of elements from all proteins within the human reviewed proteome downloaded from UniProt, then dividing by the total monoisotopic mass of the entire proteome, yielding an atoms-per-dalton ratio for each element.

The composition is calculated as:

$n_E = r_E \cdot M_{\textrm{neutral}} + n_{E,\textrm{ion}}$

where:

- $n_E$ is the estimated count of element $E$
- $r_E$ is the averagine ratio (atoms per dalton) for element $E$
- $M_{\textrm{neutral}}$ is the neutral peptide mass
- $n_{E,\textrm{ion}}$ is the elemental contribution from the ion type

The averagine ratios (atoms/Da) derived from the human proteome are:

- C: 0.044179
- H: 0.069749
- N: 0.012344
- O: 0.013352
- S: 0.000400

**Table 1** presents the level of ProForma support implemented in Peptacular. The package currently supports all ProForma 2.1 features for linear peptides. Cross-linked peptides (both inter- and intrachain) and branched structures are not currently supported. Ion notation is also not supported at the sequence level; however, the package provides extensive fragmentation support through either API. Support levels are designated as follows: [B] - Base ProForma support, [2] - ProForma 2, [T] - Top down, [X] - Cross linking, [G] - Glycan, [A] - Advanced.
