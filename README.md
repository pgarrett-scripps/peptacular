## Warnings

- The internal fragment ion mass calculation may not be accurate. Fairly certain that the ay, by, and cy internal fragments are correct.
- GNO and RESID mods are disabled for now since very few were able to be parsed.
- Project is still under development. I will be adding more features and fixing bugs as I find them.
